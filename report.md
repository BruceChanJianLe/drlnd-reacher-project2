# Report

This report describes my implementation to solve the reacher project.

## Learning Algorithm

The implementation here is a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm. Some example code can be found on udacity's official github [repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/ddpg-bipedal). Some alterations have been done on the second implementation such as changing their hyper-parameters which can be found below.
